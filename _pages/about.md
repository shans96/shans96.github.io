Hi, I'm Shan. 

I have 4 years of experience in the field of Software Development. I am currently working as a Software Engineer, while studying to obtain my MSc in Computer Science from The University of Essex. My areas of experience include Machine Learning (namely Computer Vision), Android application development, and microservice development. My preferred programming language is Java, followed by Python and then C++, but I'd like to adopt Rust in the near future because of its versatility. 

At the moment, I am focused on the high-level aspects of software engineering. These aspects include project management and communication skills- especially between technical teams and non-technical departments. Experience has taught me the importance of planning and other, more business-centric topics; it is often the case that the success of a business depends on its ability to maintain client relationships and uphold investor confidence. Through my postgraduate study, I'd like to improve my critical thinking skills, and thereby find solutions to challenges that are faced in these areas.
